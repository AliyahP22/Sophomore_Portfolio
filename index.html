  <p>Welcome to my Sophomore Year Portfolio!!Within my portfolio, you can click on the links above to see some of the labs, projects, and even video games
    that I designed and developed. My journey with web and app development began in elementary school, where I first started to code. Since elementary, I was
    interested in coding. In middle school, I had graphic arts as one of my main subjects. Coming to high school knowing that I was placed in the web and app 
    development class, I was so intrigued to learn more. Throughout the course so far, I have learned so much on new styles of code and advanced my 
    knowledge on some topics that I already knew of. Creating websites and webpages may be frustrating at some points, but it is so much fun to create and design
    something of your own. I hope you enjoy my portfolio and gain some inspiration on the fun of web and app development!</p>

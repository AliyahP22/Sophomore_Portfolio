      Lab 1 was the first ever Lab I've done in my high school career. In this lab, I provided a mini introduction of myself along with an image of myself
      It also includes my 3 favorite things and 3 goals with links of resources.

    <p>For lab 2, I was being introduced on how to create a table and how to add color to a webpage. So I created a table of color and its RGB values</p>

    For Lab 3, I created a webpage and using my knowledge of CSS, I designed an appealing looking page. This was my first CSS-related Lab.

    <p>For the favicon lab, i was creating my own logo that would appear at the top of the tab of every website and webpage of mines. I
      designed it on google sheets and then using html tags I added it to my websites. 
    </p>

    <p>For the Ninja lab, I was now being introduced into JavaScript and game design and development. The main objective of this lab was to 
      program an interactive simulation in which when users click, they can create a ninja of their choice. In addition, there would also be sound
      effects and coins with the touch of a button. This project improved my HTMl and JavaScript skills
